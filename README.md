  This project entails a student mentorship android application for the GADS community project. <br/>
  Students enroll as mentors by taking a test to ensure they are well conversant with disciplines they want to mentor others in. <br/>
  Depending on the points they score in the test (if they pass the set passmark), the mentors earn initial reputation points that qualify them to start mentoring others.<br/>
  <br/>
  Students who need help in different disciplines can then enroll as mentees.<br/>
  Upon choosing a discipline, they'll be presented with a list of available mentors in that field, their reputation, comments from other mentees and their hourly rates.<br/>
  Once they settle on a mentor of their liking, they will pay for the number of hours they want to schedule that will only be billed when in active sessions with the mentor. <br/>
  <br/>
  In case the mentee wan'ts a refund, they'll get the unconsumed balance and if a mentee is not satisfied with the services of the mentor, they can vote them down and once a reputation reaches a defined threshold the mentor will be suspended for a defined time. Once the suspension period is over, they will have to retake a test to start mentoring again.
